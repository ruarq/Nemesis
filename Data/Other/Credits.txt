This game was developed being part of the
"Themed Horror Game Jam #1" hosted on itch.io.
The theme for the jam was "Omen of Doom".
Bonus challenges were
- a supernatural protagonist
- a nightmare scene/sequence
- the protagonist is impended by a higher power
The length of the submission period was four weeks.
I tried to implement a supernatural protagonist and
the protagonist is impended by a higher power (the nemesis).
